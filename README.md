# Fantasy Trader Reference Application

## The Purpose
This application is meant to be a guide when creating [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) applications. It uses all the basic functionality that most AngularJS apps will need.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leebrandt/FantasyTrader.git
```

Get the NPM and Bower packages

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

Run the app

```bash
gulp dev
```

This will start up the app and launch BrowserSync (which launches a browser).
